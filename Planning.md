## Part 1
### Idea Overview
- #### Finn.no - 2.0

### Detailed Concept
- ### Finn.no 2.0
   - My idea is that I will create a new version of Finn.no. Using my own server (raspberry Pi) to retrive data and save it, then send data to the website.
   - There will be two users;
      - The seller: They will be selling the product.
         - **In more IT terms**
         - User send data to database, and it will be saved as a new item
      - The buyer: They will be buying the products.
         - **In more IT terms**
         - User retrives data from database and it will be shown in the users *shopping cart*
   - It wil contain key things;
      - Server
      - Database (SQL)
      - Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript *(maybe)*
      - Usertesting
      - Security
   - What I will need to learn
      - How to retrive and send data from databases within the server
      - To apply the data saved in the database to the website
      - To let multiple user get access to the website
      - Publish the website (not using github(If im able too))
      - Security
